        <h2>About Our Business</h2>
        <div class="para-1">
            Over the period of the last 11 years, You have taken Computer Technology from a simple business idea to a
            revolution in the heart of Pakistan’s Information Technology market. The idea behind the development of
            Computer Technology was never about creating a retailer with good prices; but to give birth to a place where
            people could be served as a part of the family. Where they could actually feel the touch of Information
            Technology’s application in the way they are dealt with. The world has moved to the next generation of
            business relationships; and we are proud to be the first in Pakistan’s Information Technology market to
            accept that “Yes, YOU are important!” With around 1,000% growth rate, we are proud and extremely happy to
            quote that Computer Zone has a family of more then a million online family members and more than 200,000
            (and growing) customer’s offline; in comparison to a total of 10 customers 11 years ago. The world is
            changing and Computer Zone happily accepts that the customers of today are more tech savvy and demand value
            for their money. We believe that change is the only thing constant and in order to deliver to you the value
            you deserve, we are always in the process of evolving to the next best level.
        </div>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>There might still be a lot of things that you could want to know about Computer Technology. Simply Sign
                up, feel free, and don’t be shy. We never tell our customers to hush away because there are others to
                deal with or we already met our daily sales quota. So, welcome to Computer Zone; and don’t you worry
                because whether you are a corporate client or an individual customer; we are family now. Welcome to the
                Information Technology’s Revolution in Pakistan!</p>
